# SmartCents Algorithm

The **SmartCents Algorithm** utilizes classical machine learning techniques to recommend financial literacy modules to students based on their responses to a set of questions.

## How It Works

**User Input**: The application presents the user with 6 questions related to various aspects of financial literacy.

**Rating System**: Users provide ratings for each question, reflecting their proficiency or knowledge level in different areas.

**Recommendation Logic**: The algorithm analyzes these ratings and identifies the areas with the lowest scores. Based on this analysis, it recommends specific financial literacy modules that are most appropriate for the student to improve their understanding in those areas.
